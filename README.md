# Fisheries induced shifts in sea snake assemblages along the Konkan coast of India

Sea snake assemblages have changed over two decades due high fishing activity and differential mortality among species

# Working Abstract

The effects of intensive fishing on marine fauna has been a subject of global concern. Most fisheries-based studies focus on commercial aspects and little is known about the effects of concentrated fisheries on the ecology of marine predators such as sea snakes. They share the same habitats as the commercially important species and often end up as fisheries bycatch. Sea snakes play a major role in structuring benthic trophodynamics of tropical coastal waters where most of Indiaâ€™s fisheries operations are concentrated. This study was carried out between 2016 to 2018 to understand the effect of coastal fisheries on sea snake populations in the Konkan coast region situated off the central west coast of India. 922 sea snakes were encountered in trawler and gill net bycatch comprising of largely two species; Hydrophis schistosus and Hydrophis curtus (83.05% and 16.94%) respectively. Our results on species abundance were in stark contrast to results from a similar study conducted in the region in 2002-03, which recorded a dominance of H. curtus (84%) followed by H. schistosus (14%). The present study indicates continued higher fishing related mortality in H. curtus, particularly in trawlers, with 78.43% found dead, while H. schistosus recorded lower mortality rates (30.86%). The study provides empirical evidence that non-selective fishing pressures can have significant effects on assemblages of marine vertebrates and thereby have consequences for the local ecosystem.
